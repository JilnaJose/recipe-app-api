Recipe App API - AWS Deployment
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A production-ready recipe management API I deployed on AWS using Infrastructure as Code and automated CI/CD pipelines.

🎯 What I Built
---------------

I architected and deployed a scalable containerized API on AWS, demonstrating end-to-end cloud engineering skills from infrastructure design to automated deployment.

🏗️ Architecture
---------------
Multi-tier AWS deployment I implemented:

- Load Balancer: ALB with SSL termination and custom domain
- Containers: ECS Fargate with auto-scaling
- Database: RDS with multi-AZ deployment
- Storage: EFS for persistent user data
- Network: Custom VPC with public/private subnets
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions automated pipeline

💻 Tech Stack
-------------------
Infrastructure: AWS (10+ services), Terraform, Docker, GitHub Actions
Key AWS Services: ECS, RDS, EFS, VPC, ALB, Route53, ACM, IAM

📁 Project Structure

🛠️ Implementation Highlights
-------------------------------
1. Infrastructure as Code

Built complete AWS infrastructure with Terraform
Separated setup (IAM) and deploy (infrastructure) for security
Implemented proper state management and versioning

2. Security & Networking

Designed VPC with proper subnet isolation
Configured security groups with least-privilege access
Implemented SSL/TLS encryption throughout
Created IAM policies following security best practices

3. Container Orchestration

Containerized application with optimized Docker images
Set up ECS cluster with Fargate for serverless containers
Configured auto-scaling based on CPU/memory metrics
Implemented health checks and service discovery

4. CI/CD Pipeline

Automated deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions
Zero-downtime deployments with ECS blue-green strategy
Integrated testing and rollback capabilities

🔧 Key Components I Configured
------------------------------
1. Networking: VPC, subnets, security groups, NAT Gateway
2. Database: RDS PostgreSQL with automated backups
3. Load Balancing: ALB with health checks and SSL termination
4. Storage: EFS mounted to containers for persistent data
5. DNS: Route53 with automated SSL certificate management
6. Monitoring: CloudWatch logging and alerting

📊 Results Achieved
--------------------

✅ Highly Available: Multi-AZ deployment with 99.9% uptime

✅ Auto-scaling: Dynamic resource allocation

✅ Secure: End-to-end encryption and proper access controls

✅ Cost-Optimized: Pay-per-use Fargate and efficient resource sizing

✅ Automated: Zero-touch deployments with CI/CD

🎓 Skills Demonstrated
-----------------------
- Cloud Architecture: Scalable AWS multi-tier design
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform for reproducible deployments
- DevOps: Automated CI/CD with testing and deployment
- Container Technologies: Docker and ECS orchestration
- Security Engineering: Comprehensive security implementation
- Database Management: RDS configuration and optimization

🚀 Deployment Process
-----------------------------

- Setup: AWS account and Terraform IAM configuration
- Infrastructure: VPC, database, container platform via Terraform
- Application: Containerized deployment through ECS
- Automation: CI/CD pipeline for continuous deployment
- Monitoring: CloudWatch dashboards and alerting


This project demonstrates my ability to architect, implement, and maintain production-ready cloud infrastructure on AWS using modern DevOps practices.
